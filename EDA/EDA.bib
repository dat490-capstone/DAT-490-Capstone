    abstract = {Although low-income populations have more eye problems, whether they face greater difficulty obtaining eye care appointments is unknown.To compare rates of obtaining eye care appointments and appointment wait times for those with Medicaid vs those with private insurance.In this prospective, cohort study conducted from January 1, 2017, to July 1, 2017, researchers made telephone calls to a randomly selected sample of vision care professionals in Michigan and Maryland stratified by neighborhood (urban vs rural) and professional type (ophthalmologist vs optometrist) to request the first available appointment. Appointments were sought for an adult needing a diabetic eye examination and a child requesting a routine eye examination for a failed vision screening. Researchers called each practice twice, once requesting an appointment for a patient with Medicaid and the other time for a patient with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) insurance, and asked whether the insurance was accepted and, if so, when the earliest available appointment could be scheduled.Rate of successfully made appointments and mean wait time for the first available appointment.A total of 603 telephone calls were made to 330 eye care professionals (414 calls [68.7\%] to male and 189 calls [31.3\%] to female eye care professionals). The sample consisted of ophthalmologists (303 [50.2\%]) and optometrists (300 [49.8\%]) located in Maryland (322 [53.4\%]) and Michigan (281 [46.6\%]). The rates of successfully obtaining appointments among callers were 61.5\% (95\% CI, 56.0\%-67.0\%) for adults with Medicaid and 79.3\% (95\% CI, 74.7\%-83.9\%) for adults with BCBS (P \&lt; .001) and 45.4\% (95\% CI, 39.8\%-51.0\%) for children with Medicaid and 62.5\% (95\% CI, 57.1\%-68.0\%) for children with BCBS (P \&lt; .001). Mean wait time did not vary significantly between the BCBS and Medicaid groups for both adults and children. Adults with Medicaid had significantly decreased odds of receiving an appointment compared with those with BCBS (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.59; P \&lt; .001) but had increased odds of obtaining an appointment if they were located in Michigan vs Maryland (OR, 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.49-3.87; P \&lt; .001) or with an optometrist vs an ophthalmologist (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.31-2.79; P \&lt; .001). Children with Medicaid had significantly decreased odds of receiving an appointment compared with those with BCBS (OR, 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.60; P \&lt; .001) but had increased odds of obtaining an appointment if they were located in Michigan vs Maryland (OR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.73; P = .03) or with an optometrist vs an ophthalmologist (OR, 8.00; 95\% CI, 5.37-11.90; P \&lt; .001).Callers were less successful in trying to obtain eye care appointments with Medicaid than with BCBS, suggesting a disparity in access to eye care based on insurance status, although confounding factors may have contributed to this finding. Improving access to eye care professionals for those with Medicaid may improve health outcomes and decrease health care spending in the long term.},

	abstract = {Background: Blindness describes a condition in which patients have low vision, are legally blind, or totally blind. Disparities in vision health is a public health concern because it decreases quality of life and subsequently leads to a series of other health-related issues. These disparities exist across demographics, socioeconomic status, disease history, genetics, and geographic location, particularly in the urban vs. rural setting. Public health professionals need to shed light on these disparities to properly address them to ensure that individuals affected by blindness can receive proper care.
Objective: To investigate if there are discrepancies or inequalities in vision care in a rural setting vs. urban setting.
Methods: A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis using cross-sectional data from the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS) was done using SAS Studio. Blindness, the outcome of interest, was defined as best-corrected visual acuity at less than 20/200 in the better-seeing eye. Each demographic subgroup was assessed in the counties included for upstate New York and downstate New York. Prevalence rates are expressed as a percent.
Results: The multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that non-Hispanic black individuals from upstate New York and downstate New York were most likely to be blind compared to white, non-Hispanic, any Hispanic, and other individuals. Factors that were significantly associated with blindness include the female gender, individuals aged 65 years and older, non-Hispanic black individuals, and those without Medicare. Residents from upstate New York had a slightly increased likelihood to develop blindness, 1.04 (1.01, 1.07), compared to residents in downstate New York.
Conclusions and Relevance: Blindness prevalence was highest in upstate New York, among non-Hispanic black individuals, the female gender, and individuals 65 years and older. Despite the blindness prevalence highest upstate, the difference was not clinically significant compared to downstate New York, despite a considerably larger number of resources present downstate compared to upstate. Given the severity of blindness as a public health concern, the discrepancies in eye care in urban vs. rural settings need to be investigated further.},

    abstract = {Updated estimates of the prevalence and incidence rates of low vision and blindness are needed to inform policy makers and develop plans to meet the future demands for low vision rehabilitation services.To provide updated estimates of the incidence and prevalence of low vision and blindness in the United States.Visual acuity measurements as a function of age from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with representation of racial and ethnic groups, were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of visual impairments. Data from 6016 survey participants, ranging in age from younger than 18 years to older than 45 years, were obtained to estimate prevalence rates for different age groups. Incidence and prevalence rates of low vision (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] in the better-seeing eye of \&lt;20/40 and \&lt;20/60) and blindness (BCVA of ≤20/200) in older adults were estimated from exponential models, fit to prevalence rates as a function of age (specified in 5-year age bins). The prevalence and annual incidence of low vision and blindness in the United States were estimated, using the 2010 US census data by age, from the rate models applied to the census projections for 2017, 2030, and 2050. Data were collected from November 1, 2007, to October 31, 2008. Data analysis took place from March 31, 2016, to March 19, 2017.Prevalence and incidence rates of low vision and blindness in the United States.Of the 6016 people in the study, 1714 (28.4\%) were younger than 18 years of age, 2358 (39.1\%) were 18 to 44 years of age, and 1944 (32.3\%) were 45 years of age or older. There were 2888 male (48\%) and 3128 female (52\%) participants. The prevalence of low vision and blindness for older adults (≥45 years) in the United States in 2017 is estimated to be 3 894 406 persons (95\% CI, 3 034 442-4 862 549 persons) with a BCVA less than 20/40, 1 483 703 persons (95\% CI, 968 656-2 370 513 persons) with a BCVA less than 20/60, and 1 082 790 persons (95\% CI, 637 771-1 741 864 persons) with a BCVA of 20/200 or less. The estimated 2017 annual incidence (projected from 2010 census data) of low vision and blindness among older adults (≥45 years) in the United States is 481 970 persons (95\% CI, 375 541-601 787 persons) with a BCVA less than 20/40, 183 618 persons (95\% CI, 119 878-293 367 persons) with a BCVA less than 20/60, and 134 002 persons (95\% CI, 83 383-215 567 persons) with a BCVA of 20/200 or less. The total annual incidence for each BCVA criterion is 12.4\% of the total prevalence.Low vision and blindness affect a substantial portion of the older population in the United States. Estimates of the prevalence and annual incidence of visual impairment assist policy planners in allocating and developing resources for this life-changing loss of function.},
